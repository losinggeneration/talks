* Status Quo

Most response writers follow something like
.code interface_driven_http_response_writers/status_quo.go

* Can we do better?

* What if the response writer was able to look something like this:
.code interface_driven_http_response_writers/interface_writer.go

* What else can this do?

* Write headers
.code interface_driven_http_response_writers/headers.go

* Set a status code
.code interface_driven_http_response_writers/status_code.go

* Set a Content-Type
.code interface_driven_http_response_writers/content_type.go

* Set Content-Type & Marshal a value
.code interface_driven_http_response_writers/accept.go

* Look at the Accept header and choose the correct marshaller
.code interface_driven_http_response_writers/acceptable.go

* Example
.code interface_driven_http_response_writers/example.go

* Demo

* Is it worth it?

Pros

- A consistent API for writing data of about any type
- DRY

Cons

- Order of parameters matter for Responsers that transform & for some operations like WriteHeader
- This implementation was created for this talk
